Let's look at the get rich quick scheme.

These scheme's are advertised by the schemers as a special opportunity that you have to become incredibly wealthy.
"They" are not smart enough to know the opportunities that are right in front of them, but "you" are.
You are one of the pioneers, a maverick.
You have possesion of special knowledge.
You are not a sucker.

This is the common sales tactic that fraudsters give.
Importantly though, we use that tactic to our own selves. Maybe we don't have access to special knowledge, 
but we follow someone online who we think does. We feel smart by proxy.

Of course, there is a danger in this exceptionality. In fact, we are just regular human beings swept along by various forces
outside of our control. We are a part of an aggrogate. We believe things for reasons OTHER than being endowed
with a special gift towards understanding the world.

Let's phrase it in a probabibalistic way:
What are the chances that I am a "very special person" compared to the chances that I believe in something
based on political-social-psychological-etc contingencies?

Our egos are very satisfied when we beleive we are not the sucker.
The issue is a) someone always benefits by you believing that you are not the sucker,
and b) believing that you aren't the sucker closes your mind to new information.
The self proclaimed suckers are the ones that notice novel opportunities in the end.

Moreover, self-proclaimed suckers probably don't value the new opportunities available to them as much as the "non-sucker"
would, but that is for a different time.

Note: Is me writing this a manifestation of my percieved "non-sucker" belief?
