There's a fly in the sexually progressive ointment. A fly that's getting bigger and bigger.
This is a fly that supports the disconnection and confusion that we have in the modern day.
The fly is sexual liberalization.

The sexual revoluation occured in a particular context: one of stable social systems,
high social capital, and informal institutions of sociability, community, and group interest.
At the time, freedom was a new resource in surplus. Thanks to the effciency of industrialization,
along with material wealth famously procured after the Second World War, a generation was raised
with the expansion of freedom, both in ideology and in leisure. This generation then asked itself
a burning question: "What about sex?"

In contrast to today, "sex" was not merely a mechanical process between two or more people
which brought plenty of pleasure to the individuals involved. Rather, given the norms
and values of the generation that came before, sex was very much a child of the romantic era.
Sex was in the realm of the sacred, of the poetic expression between those involved. It was
freedom in the context of the other.

Of course, this "old" sex was drenched in judgement and orthodoxy. The sacredness in the sexual
expression was not given free reign in the romantic context. There was a procedure and the
freedom that could be expressed was carefully constructed. This is okay, that is not.

The idealism of the Sexual Revolution was the following: What if we could remove the 
boundaries of sex and increase the freedom (and creativity) of the act IN ORDER to increase
our exposure to the sacred? Additional interest in spirituality, music, and psychedelic drugs
was not an accident here, either. The goal was increase their exposure to the sacred which the previous
generations barred them from, for reason they did not understand.

"Imagine a world in which you could love everyone? Where the love could increase infinitely?
Where we would have the freedom to express ourselves fully with no reservation? What if there
were no orthodoxy?"

The impulses and vision was an admirable one, however sophmoric and naive it may have been. It is, then, 
a tragedy to see what this movement has paved the way towards: the situation we're in now.

The sacredness was lost...
