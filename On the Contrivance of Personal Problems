As I am getting older, one thing is becoming more and more clear:
Internal human problems are most often significantly contrived by the person having the problem.

The classic story of a patient in therapy:
The therapist spends hours and hours consoling and trying to fix the issues of the client,
however the client, in their own eccentric way, prevents the issue from being fixed.
Therapy itself becomes a type of fight--one says "I have the cure for you right here",
the other says "No! It can't possibly work! That's not good enough!"

The difficulty is that people are often incorrect when they describe their own problems.
They may complain about a family member, a job, where they live, etc., but at the same time
they are unwilling to ignore the family member, quit the job, or move to a different place.
This is how the problem is contrived. The solution to the problems that are explicitly stated 
are so simple and easy that the problem haver themself has thought about every possible solution
already. The issue is that they do not want the problem solved in a way that will remove the
problem from their life. In fact, the problem being present often has difficult to see positive
consequences for the problem haver such as a defense to their own ego. A bad job you hate 
may actually save you from feeling the self-hatred and self-doubt you face whenever you 
actually exhert yourself in a path that is worth something. Complaining about that job
may give you a sense of control or an easy fix: "If just this one problem is fixed, I'll
have the GOOD bad job.

To be reductive, we can summarize it all in the behaviroal method of analysis:
organisms flee from painful stimuli. No fleeing, no pain!
