We all intuitively understand the benefits (and aesthetic) of a society with high trust.
The important thing to realize, however, is that high trust gives lying a HUGE 
short term benefit. It's possible that trust doesn't scale. Imagine a worldwide,
trustful society. The benefits of lying would be astronomical in the short term,
and it'd probably only take one person to essentially nuke the civilization.

More trust means bigger incentives for enforcement and punishment. The most trustful society
would also have the most rutheless legal system.

It's apparent why we opt for a trustless society. No one is believed outright--innocent until
proven guilty. It's a trade off of course--now nobody trusts another.
