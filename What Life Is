The childish conception:
Life is about taking the maximum amount of pleasure you can.
Doing one thing that doesn't give you as much joy as something else?
Go to the next thing and enjoy the high of novelty.
It's semi-chaotic but you're too excited to care!

The more adult conception:
Life is about commitment.
Commitment is when you say: "I will do this in pursuit of a value I 
find important, and despite the inevitable pain, boredom, or doubt
I *will* experience, I will stay the course."

The adult conception has a life, maybe not as exciting or as pleasurable,
but it is a life that's solid, in a sense. It has a form you can hold.
A depth. And of course, not only does the life itself have depth,
but how that life affects the individual with it is also deeper.

In a way, the real settling is the constant search for pleasure.
