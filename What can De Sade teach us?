1. The Sexual Revolution was not nihilist, nor amoral.

The Sexual Revolution of the 60s was not a wasteland of values. Instead, it was a replacement of them. Certain acts became newly moral,
others became newly immoral. This is why it is possible that the writings of De Sade, arguably the most sexually progressive man
in history, is hated equally by the proponents and critics of the Sexual Revolution.

De Sade offers a view of the world which disgusts both left and right temperaments. In a sense, left and right are astonishingly similar,
just not in content.

2. No meaning means NO MEANING.

In De Sade's thinking, there is no god, there is no ultimate meaning, and value judgements are absolutely created by man and not found 
"out there". Nature is absolutely indifferent in every aspect, and as a resolut: there is no prescription.

In this way, the "good" act and the "bad" act are fundamentally equal. Everything is permitted.

3. Our fear towards freedom.

De Sade's freedom is as absolute as it can be--an idea which inspires revulsion and disgust. Indeed, most will agree with De Sade's starting
positions, but they will be abducted by particular reactions once he makes his implications known.

Many enlightened souls consider themselves lovers of freedom, however their revulsion towards De Sade shows an unstable relationship towards
freedom. If freedom *should* have limits, to what can we derive those limits from?
